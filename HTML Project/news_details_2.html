     <p>An international team led by Northwestern University has successfully created an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can detect, identify, and classify supernovae.
     This fully automated system, known as the Bright Transient Survey Bot (BTSbot), is set to revolutionise the way astronomers study these cosmic explosions.</p>
     <p>The BTSbot is designed to automate the entire process of searching for new supernovae across the night sky, effectively eliminating human involvement. This not only accelerates the process of analyzing and classifying new supernova candidates but also eliminates the possibility of human error.</p>
     <p>Over the past six years, humans have spent an estimated 2,200 hours visually inspecting and classifying supernova candidates. With the introduction of BTSbot, this time can now be redirected towards other research responsibilities, thereby accelerating the pace of discovery.</p>
