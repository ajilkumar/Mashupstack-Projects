   <p>An immense tragedy is playing out in Israel and Gaza. It has devoured thousands of Israeli and Palestinian lives, mostly civilians; and it is likely to claim many thousands more.</p>
   <p>We are staring at an unfolding catastrophe – and yet collectively we seem to be able to do nothing to stop it. That is a stain on us all.</p>
   <p>The sophisticated military operation that Hamas launched earlier this month – firing thousands of rockets out of its Gaza stronghold north into Israel and sending thousands of its fighters over and under Israel’s heavily armoured border fence – had the advantage of surprise. For the Hamas fighters, this was largely a suicide mission. Their cruel goal was to take as many Israelis as they could down with them.</p>

    <p>An international team led by Northwestern University has successfully created an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can detect, identify, and classify supernovae.
    This fully automated system, known as the Bright Transient Survey Bot (BTSbot), is set to revolutionise the way astronomers study these cosmic explosions.</p>
    <p>The BTSbot is designed to automate the entire process of searching for new supernovae across the night sky, effectively eliminating human involvement. This not only accelerates the process of analyzing and classifying new supernova candidates but also eliminates the possibility of human error.</p>
    <p>Over the past six years, humans have spent an estimated 2,200 hours visually inspecting and classifying supernova candidates. With the introduction of BTSbot, this time can now be redirected towards other research responsibilities, thereby accelerating the pace of discovery.</p>
